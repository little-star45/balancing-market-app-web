In Poland we can distinguish several types of energy markets, depending on the required date of delivery. The energy price set on the Day-Ahead or Intraday Market is rarely the final price. In the 24 hours between the conclusion of a contract on the Polish Power Exchange, the energy demand profile can change completely. Depending on whether there is too much ("down-regulation") or too
little ("up-regulation") energy on the market, its final price is higher or lower than previously set.

My application allows you to study the relationship between energy prices in the market in these two situations. The green line is a graph connecting energy producers' volume bids (X axis) with price bids (Y axis). The sliders allow us to manipulate the actual demand in both markets and observe price changes. This is a Python rewrite of one of the applications from my master's thesis available at the following link: https://ses.agh.edu.pl/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/MSc_Patrycja_Domanska.pdf
